This week, I used AI tools to:

Coursework Help

I asked ChatGPT for assistance organizing my schoolwork and creating a plan to stay on track with assignments.

Writing Support

I used AI to help draft and polish written work, making sure my responses were clear and aligned with assignment requirements.

Learning Enhancement

I asked AI to break down videos and readings into simple notes so I could understand the material more effectively.

Reflection: AI has been useful as a study partner this week, especially for organizing my thoughts and saving time on writing tasks. I still double-check the output, but it makes the process more efficient.
