This week was mainly about cleaning up the data model and making it feel more “real,” and honestly it helped everything click a lot more. I didn’t realize how much difference little things like @property setters and __post_init__ actually make until I had to use them. Once I added validation to the title and copies fields, I could see how the class basically protects itself from bad data. That made the whole system feel way more solid.

Working with the special methods like __lt__, __eq__, and __contains__ was the part that actually surprised me the most. Just implementing those changed how the objects behave in Python without me having to write separate functions for everything. For example, having the catalog automatically sort itself by title when I iterate over it felt clean and professional, and using in catalog with both an ISBN and a Book object made the container feel natural.
