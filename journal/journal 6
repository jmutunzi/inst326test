This week, I used AI primarily to help me complete and understand my OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) exercises for INST326.
Each problem involved building different Python classes — like Book, Member, Loan, Library, and several helper utilities such as DateUtils, LoanPolicy, and Formatter.

AI helped me:

Structure my class definitions cleanly with correct attributes and methods.

Learn how to use class methods, static methods, and dataclasses properly.

Understand how to link classes together (for example, how Library uses Member, Loan, and Catalog).

Write readable and testable Python code while keeping it consistent with assignment guidelines.
