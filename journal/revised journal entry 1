How I studied this week:

I attended TA help hours, which gave me direct support on a few of the Week 1 practice exercises.

I also watched the online lecture videos to review topics like variables, strings, arithmetic, and boolean expressions.

These resources were the main way I learned how to approach and complete the exercises.

AI Use:

I used AI only briefly to clarify a couple of small points (like how f-strings format numbers or how .strip() works for cleaning up input).

The majority of my progress came from the TA sessions and the professorâ€™s videos.

Reflection:
The combination of TA help days + lecture videos gave me a stronger understanding of the basics. AI was just a side reference when I wanted quick confirmation, but not the main source of learning.
